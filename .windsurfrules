## Project structure
Follow the Bulletproof React architecture pattern (refer to: https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md):
- components/ 
    - ui/(shadcn-ui components default installation folder)
    - core/(shared component across features))
    - [component-name] / 
        - src/ (the component itself or sub-components. For example: List, List-Item)
        - tests/ (unit tests for this component)
        - types/ (TypeScript types for this component)
        - hooks/ (hooks used only by this component)
- features/ (feature-based modules)
    - [feature-name]/
    - api/ (API calls related to the feature)
    - components/ (components used only by this feature. Each component follows the defined "[component-name]/..." structure above)
    - stores/ (state stores for this feature)
    - tests/ (unit tests for this feature)
    - types/ (TypeScript types for this feature)
    - hooks/ (hooks used only by this feature)
    - utils/ (utility functions specific to this feature)
    - index.ts (one entry file public export - optional)
- hooks/ (shared hooks used across the application)
- lib/ (re-exports from libraries and our own abstractions)
- providers/ (application providers)
- stores/ (global state stores)
- types/ (shared TypeScript types)
- utils/ (shared utility functions)
- app/ (Nextjs pages)
    - [feature-route]/ (routes organized by feature)
- public / 
    - assets/ (static files like images, fonts, etc.)


## When building Core components (located at "components\core"), remember to:
- Always use the theme variables defined in global.css file for consistent styling across the project and design system alignment. Even if I tell you to follow fixed values, that just reference for you to choose appropriate Tailwind utilities from the theme variables.
- Use this command only `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` whenever you need to install shadcn components. DONT EVER use `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>`

## When building UI layouts, remember to:
- Always start with the "core" components folder (located at "components\core") to get necessary components to build the layout. DO NOT EVER use any other component from "components" folder unless I explicitly tell you to. 
- In case you need to use components from other folders or third-party libraries, you must inform me. 

## Remember to follow NextJS best practices:
- Utilize App Router for routing
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Image component for optimized images. If you detect any Image component that use external link, you must inform me to replace the source with local assets
- Link component for client-side navigation
- Head component for metadata
- Implement proper loading states
- Use 'use client' directive only when necessary: Event listeners, Browser APIs, State management, Client-side-only libraries

## When implementing features
- Each feature directory should contain domain-specific code for a given feature
- All features should have a clear and well-defined public API exposed through their index.ts file
