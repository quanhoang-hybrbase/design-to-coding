# Work Logs

## March 6, 2025 - Theme Variable Refinement

### Summary of Changes

1. Fixed font size theme variables in globals.css to match Tailwind CSS 4 naming convention
2. Preserved original Figma token values for font sizes
3. Improved description text color for better readability

### Detailed Implementation Notes

#### Theme Variable Fixes

- **Font Size Variables**:
  - Changed variable naming from `--text-size-*` to `--text-*` to match Tailwind CSS 4 standards
  - Preserved the original Figma token values:
    - `--text-xs`: 0.75rem (12px)
    - `--text-sm`: 0.875rem (14px)
    - `--text-base`: 1rem (16px)
    - `--text-lg`: 1.125rem (18px)
    - `--text-xl`: 1.25rem (20px)
    - `--text-2xl`: 1.5rem (24px)
    - `--text-3xl`: 2rem (32px)
    - `--text-4xl`: 2.25rem (36px)
    - `--text-5xl`: 2.5rem (40px)
    - `--text-6xl`: 3rem (48px)
    - `--text-7xl`: 3.5rem (56px)
  - Added line height variables for each text size (e.g., `--text-3xl--line-height`)

- **SectionTitle Component**:
  - Updated description text color from `text-text-strong-950` to `text-text-sub-600` for better contrast and readability
  - Maintained existing responsive text size classes with the corrected theme variables

### Technical Learnings

#### Tailwind CSS 4 Theme Variable Standards

- **Naming Convention**: Tailwind CSS 4 uses `--text-*` format for font size variables, not `--text-size-*`
- **Figma Token Integration**: Important to maintain the original Figma token values while adopting the framework's naming conventions
- **Line Heights**: Each text size should have a corresponding line height variable
- **Importance of Standards**: Following framework conventions ensures compatibility with future updates and maintains consistency across the codebase

## March 6, 2025 - Component Refinement and Theme Variables

### Summary of Changes

1. Updated the SectionTitle component to implement requirements from PRD.md
2. Learned proper usage of theme variables in Tailwind CSS 4

### Detailed Implementation Notes

#### SectionTitle Component Updates

- **New Props Implementation**:
  - Added `length` prop with 'Medium' and 'Long' options to control heading font size
  - Added `alignment` prop with 'Center' and 'Left' options for content alignment
  - Applied proper spacing according to design specifications (gap-3 for mobile, gap-4 for desktop)

- **Theme Variable Usage**:
  - Implemented proper usage of theme variables from globals.css
  - Used direct theme variable references (e.g., `text-text-sub-600`) instead of arbitrary color values
  - Applied responsive typography with appropriate text sizes for different screen sizes

### Technical Learnings

#### Tailwind CSS 4 Theme Variables

- **Proper Usage**: Theme variables should be used directly in class names (e.g., `text-text-sub-600`) rather than using CSS variable syntax (`text-[var(--color-text-sub-600)]`)
- **Benefits**:
  - Cleaner and more readable code
  - Consistent styling across the application
  - Automatic adaptation to theme changes
  - Follows project's styling guidelines of never using arbitrary values

- **Available Theme Variables**:
  - Text colors: `text-text-strong-950`, `text-text-sub-600`, etc.
  - Background colors: `bg-bg-strong-950`, `bg-bg-weak-50`, etc.
  - Spacing: Using standard Tailwind spacing utilities that reference theme variables

## March 6, 2025 - SectionTitle Component Alignment with PRD

### Summary of Changes

1. Updated the SectionTitle component to match the exact specifications in PRD.md
2. Corrected text sizes and colors to align with design requirements

### Detailed Implementation Notes

#### SectionTitle Component Updates

- **Text Color Corrections**:
  - Changed description text color from `text-text-sub-600` to `text-text-strong-950` to match PRD specifications
  - Maintained tagline color as `text-text-sub-600`
  - Kept heading color as `text-text-strong-950`

- **Font Size Adjustments**:
  - Updated heading sizes to match PRD specifications:
    - Mobile: Changed from `text-3xl` (32px) to `text-4xl` (36px)
    - Desktop (long): Changed from `md:text-5xl` (40px) to `md:text-6xl` (48px)
    - Desktop (medium): Changed from `md:text-4xl` (36px) to `md:text-5xl` (40px)
  - Maintained description text sizes: `text-base` (16px) on mobile and `md:text-lg` (18px) on desktop

- **Responsive Behavior**:
  - Preserved the responsive gap between elements: 12px on mobile (gap-3) and 16px on desktop (md:gap-4)
  - Maintained alignment options (center/left) as specified in the PRD

### Technical Learnings

- **PRD Alignment**: Importance of regularly verifying component implementations against PRD specifications
- **Theme Variable Usage**: Proper application of theme variables for consistent styling across components
- **Responsive Design**: Maintaining mobile-first approach with appropriate breakpoints for desktop styling
